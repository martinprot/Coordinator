# Coordinator

Project forked from very good RadiantTap Coordinator's

https://github.com/radianttap/Coordinator

Although the `Coordinator` par of his lib is excellent, the `UIResponder` part was not my taste.

So I forked his lib to remove the responder part.

## The pattern

- the [Pattern](documentation/Pattern.md) from Radiant Tap
