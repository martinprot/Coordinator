# Coordinator

Project forked from very good RadiantTap Coordinator's

https://github.com/radianttap/Coordinator

Although the `Coordinator` part of his lib is excellent, the `UIResponder` part was not my taste.

So I forked his lib to remove the responder part.

## The pattern

- the [Pattern](documentation/Pattern.md) from Radiant Tap
- Soroush Khanlou: [Coordinators Redux](http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/)
- Andrey Panov: [Coordinators Essential tutorial](https://medium.com/blacklane-engineering/coordinators-essential-tutorial-part-i-376c836e9ba7)
